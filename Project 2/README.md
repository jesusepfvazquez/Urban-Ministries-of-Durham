**Project 2**
**BIOS 611**
**FALL 2019**

**Background Description**

Urban Ministries of Durham assist around 6,000 people each year who need food, shelter, clothing and/or supportive services. Some of the programs that they offer is a (1) community shelter where people are given a place to sleep and assistance to help them find a home, a (2) Community Café serves three meals a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and a (3) food and clothing closet for those that either need food or clothing. Donations, just to as any homeless shelter, are important to maintain services, therefore communicating the importance of donations should be a high priority.

**Motivation**

Financial support was a service provided by the Urban Ministries of Durham but was discontinued. Some individuals need financial support to be able to get to another state where they have family, or they might just need to pay their electricity bill during the summer. This shinny will allow service members to understand how and when financial support was used. 

**Approach**

This shinny will allow the user to select the type of bill used to pay for financial support. The user will be given a box-plot in addition with the mean, max, min and the dates when the min and max of the awarded amount.
