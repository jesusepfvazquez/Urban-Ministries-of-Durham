**PROJECT 3**
**BIOS 611**
**FALL 2019**

**Background Description**

Urban Ministries of Durham assist around 6,000 people each year who need food, shelter, clothing and/or supportive services. Some of the programs that they offer is a (1) community shelter where people are given a place to sleep and assistance to help them find a home, a (2) Community Caf√© that serves three meals a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and a (3) food and clothing closet for those that either need food or clothing. 

**Motivation**

Just as with any other organization, validation of the organization efforts is needed to understand if Urban Minisitries of Durham is doing a good job at helping people transform their lives. Having this information at hand when meeting with donors can give a sense of security that their donations are not going to waste. Not only are the efforts of counselors into helping homeless find a home important but one should also consider how finances are being managed at the homesless shelter. For this reason the tax records will be examined to show if there are any signs of fradulent behavior. To inspect the work of counselors, this project will examine if the shelter reduces the number of diabilities reported by new-incomers by the time they find a home.

**Approach**

To determine the financial performance of the organization from the Urban Ministries of Durham the first digit of the net income, expenses and income-expenses will be considered. Theoretically, this should follow a Bendford distribution and any deviations from this distribution would suggest fabricated numbers. For the second part of the project, we will count the number of patients that came in with a condition (e.g. - mental health problem) and left with (1) none, (2) the same, or (3) with more problems. The change in health related conditions will be illustrated using bar-plots, stratified by ethnicity.
